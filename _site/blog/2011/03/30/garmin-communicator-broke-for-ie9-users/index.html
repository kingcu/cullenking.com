    <p>If you have the Garmin Communicator <span class="caps">API</span> integrated into your site, and you have noticed IE9 no longer works with the new <span class="caps">FIT</span> enabled devices, it&#8217;s not your fault!  While I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a bug in the Communicator plugin or an intentional move by Garmin, Connect is the only site which allows IE9 users with <span class="caps">FIT</span> enabled devices like the Edge 500 and Edge 800 series to sync.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a simple solution.  You just have to jump into the Communicator javascript <span class="caps">API</span> and change a few things.  The problem is that the actual browser plugin says that the device doesn&#8217;t support the <span class="caps">FIT</span> file format.  The solution is &#8220;faking&#8221; the results for users with the newer devices.</p>
<p>To fake out the plugin, I simply use a regular expression to check that the actual name of the <span class="caps">GPS</span> device matches a <span class="caps">FIT</span> enabled device.  In this solution I only have a regex that detects Edge 500 and Edge 800 devices, and you may want to expand the expression to other devices.</p>
<p>First, open up GarminDevicePlugin.js and head to the initialize function, which is around line 51.</p>
<filter:code lang="javascript" theme="blackboard">
initialize: function(pluginElement) {
this.plugin = pluginElement;
this.unlocked = false;
this.deviceName = &quot;&quot;;
//console.debug(&#8220;DevicePlugin constructor supportsFitnessWrite=&#8221;+this.supportsFitnessWrite)
},
</filter:code>
<p>Notice how I added the field deviceName to the class object.  We will use this to assign the first detected device&#8217;s name to the plugin, so that it can use a regex later.  In order to assign this value when the device itself is detected, we have to modify GarminDeviceControl.js at line 240:</p>
<filter:code lang="javascript" theme="blackboard">
_finishFindDevices: function() {
if(this.garminPlugin.finishFindDevices()) {
this.devices = Garmin.PluginUtils.parseDeviceXml(this.garminPlugin, this.getDetailedDeviceData);
this.numDevices = this.devices.length;
this.deviceNumber = 0;
if(this.devices.length &gt; 0) this.garminPlugin.deviceName = this.devices<sup class="footnote" id="fnr0"><a href="#fn0">0</a></sup>.getDisplayName();
this._broadcaster.dispatch(&#8220;onFinishFindDevices&#8221;, {controller: this});
} else {
setTimeout(function() { this._finishFindDevices() }.bind(this), 500);
}
},
</filter:code>
<p>We only assign the device name if there actually is a device detected.  Also it is important that we do this before the onFinishFindDevices event is dispatched.</p>
<p>Final piece of the puzzle is actually using this information.  To do this, we head back to GarminDevicePlugin.js and head to line 161 and the function &#8220;getSupportsFitnessDirectoryRead&#8221;.  There are a few functions we want to add this check to, including &#8220;getSupportsFitDirectoryRead&#8221;.  I simply added another function to do the actual checking which returns true or false, then call that function wherever I need to.</p>
<filter:code lang="javascript" theme="blackboard">
isFitEnabledEdge: function() {
if(this.deviceName.match(/edge (5|8)00/i)) return true;
return false;
},

	getSupportsFitnessWrite: function() {<br />

	getSupportsFitDirectoryRead: function() {		<br />
            if(this.isFitEnabledEdge()) return true;<br />
            return this._getPluginFunctionExists(&#8220;StartReadFITDirectory&#8221;);<br />

	 */<br />
	getSupportsFitnessReadCompressed: function() {<br />
            if(this.isFitEnabledEdge()) return true;<br />
            return this._getPluginFieldExists(this.plugin.TcdXmlz);<br />
	},</p>
</filter:code>
<p>There may be more places where this is needed, but this works for my simple use cases, merely reading files from <span class="caps">GPS</span> devices.  Hope this helps!</p>
