    <p>After the Garmin Edge 500 came out with its new fileformat, <span class="caps">FIT</span>, I tried to get support for the device on the ridewithgps Garmin Sync page.  However, using the exact same method Garmin Connect uses in the <span class="caps">API</span>, I was unable to get anything to work.  Turns out, they blocked third party websites from using that portion of the <span class="caps">API</span>.  Best guess says it is for bug testing purposes&#8230;It&#8217;s easier to debug something in a controlled environment you control, rather than hearing grief from all the developers using the <span class="caps">API</span>.  In any event, they announced a beta developers plugin with support for <span class="caps">FIT</span> devices.</p>

<p>ridewithgps might be one of the first sites to support direct sync with <span class="caps">FIT</span> devices!</p>
