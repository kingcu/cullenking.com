    <p>I just recovered from a scary situation in which I lost a whole commit to git by accidentally working out of the &#8220;no branch&#8221; branch in git.  I would have only lost around 2 hours of work, however, two hours is a decent amount when you are already pressed for time!  After about three minutes of googling I came across a link which saved me.  The gist of it is below:</p>
<filter:code lang="xml" theme="blackboard">
kingcu@kingcu-desktop:~/ridewithgps$ git reflog show
b709fac&#8230; HEAD@{3}: pull origin new_garmin_sync: Merge made by recursive.
b6e1616&#8230; HEAD@{4}: commit: intermediate checkin for Cam. UI is wired up to send to server, now just needs some massaging for generating extra info for a trip like associated route, etc
</filter:code>
<p>The commit that was not in any branch is the &#8216;intermediate checkin&#8217; commit.  Now that we have a part of the <span class="caps">SHA</span> hash, we can use git log to show the commit, get the full hash and then merge it into the branch we want:</p>
<filter:code lang="xml" theme="blackboard">

kingcu@kingcu-desktop:~/ridewithgps$ git log b6e1616
&#8230;..
&#8230;..
kingcu@kingcu-desktop:~/ridewithgps$ git merge b6e16166608b5be148b5dc0a721af3e8d15de282
</filter:code>
<p>Here is the blog which helped me arrive at this solution:</p>
