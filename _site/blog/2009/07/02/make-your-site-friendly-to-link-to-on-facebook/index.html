    <p>Here is a quick but helpful tidbit for any site.  You can direct Facebook to a particular preview thumbnail to show when a user links to your page on Facebook.  If you don&#8217;t specify a thumbnail, Facebook will give a user a few options to choose from.  Where this comes in handy is on pages that don&#8217;t need that thumbnail visible, but having that thumbnail available as a preview is valuable.</p>
<p>For example, when viewing a route or trip on <a href="http://ridewithgps.com">http://ridewithgps.com</a> there is already a large interactive map of the route for a user to play with.  Placing a thumbnail of that route somewhere on the page becomes redundant on an already cluttered layout.  However, when linking to the route from Facebook we want users to see a small thumbnail preview of the route.  Simply add a link in your head tag like so:</p>
<filter:code lang="html" theme="blackboard">
<link href='http://ridewithgps.com/routes/2602/thumb.gif' rel='image_src' />
</filter:code>
<p>This will produce a neat looking preview that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/facebookLinkExample.jpg" alt="" /></p>
