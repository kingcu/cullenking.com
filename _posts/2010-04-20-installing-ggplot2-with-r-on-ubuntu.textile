Had an issue installing the ggplot2 library for making a few graphs using R.  I ran into a snag when I opened up the R console and tried to install the library, getting an error:

<filter:code lang="xml" theme="blackboard">
  > install.packages("ggplot2")
  install.packages("ggplot2") : package ‘plyr’ is not available
</filter:code>

Turns out, Ubuntu has an older version of R than the latest ggplot requires, so, I had to pull down and install R from source.  Not too hard, you can get the source at "The Comprehensive R Archive Network":http://cran.r-project.org/

Installing from source is as simple as the standard:

<filter:code lang="xml" theme="blackboard">
  ./configure
  make -j8
  sudo make install
</filter:code>

where -j8 is taking advantage of the quad-core processor in my machine.
Enjoy!
