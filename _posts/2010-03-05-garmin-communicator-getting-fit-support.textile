After the Garmin Edge 500 came out with its new fileformat, FIT, I tried to get support for the device on the ridewithgps Garmin Sync page.  However, using the exact same method Garmin Connect uses in the API, I was unable to get anything to work.  Turns out, they blocked third party websites from using that portion of the API.  Best guess says it is for bug testing purposes...It's easier to debug something in a controlled environment you control, rather than hearing grief from all the developers using the API.  In any event, they announced a beta developers plugin with support for FIT devices.

Announced in their forums here:

ridewithgps might be one of the first sites to support direct sync with FIT devices!
